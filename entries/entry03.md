# Entry 3
##### 1/5/20

#### Progress
Since the second blog entry, I mainly focused on studying [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) code.
During my exploration of Arduino's code, I learned about the code for RFID RC522, such as creating an MFRC522 instance:

`MFRC522 mfrc522(SS_PIN, RST_PIN);`

<br>
I was able to review my previous understanding for Arduino by reading [Circuito](https://www.circuito.io/blog/arduino-code/)'s blog
post that recap about a major part of Arduino's code which is the setup() and the loop(). I also noticed
that Arduino's code is built using C/C++ so I also tried to learn some of the basics of C/C++. I find that
learning Java in class has helped mean learn both Arduino's code and C/C++ much easier, such as creating
classes and methods.

#### Decisions
I am going to continue to familiarize myself with Arduino's code. Specifically, I will try to learn the
code for Arduino's LCD, which will be used to display any important information, and the Solenoid lock,
which will be our way to lock the door, to be able to create our proper Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

After I have familiarized myself with the code, I would like to start to test my code using what Shuquan
have started to build.

#### Engineering Design Process
We are currently in the step of creating our prototype. Shuquan has started to build and put
the parts together onto the breadboard.
Even though we have started to create our prototype, we still need to learn more about our part
of the project. For example, I still need to become more comfortable with Arduino's code and how it
can be used.

#### Skill/Skills
The two most important skills that I have been developing my skills to be able to use search engine
efficiency and learn how to read about the important parts of the documentation. Search engines,
like Google, have ways, such as filtering and using keywords, to make it easier for me to search
for what I need. For example, my current research goal is to understand the code of Arduino and
C/C++ so my search will include keywords like "learn", "code", "Arduino", and the occasional "YouTube."
It is also important to know how to read the documentation of what I am looking for. Even though some
documentation can have accurate information, but if it does not relate to what I want to learn more about
it would not be useful. The best way for me was to read the titles and subtitles to see if these are important.
I proceed to speed read some sentences of different paragraphs. If it helps me I would save it first
and then read the full documentation.
