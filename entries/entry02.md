#### Introduction
From the last blog entry, I have research more about home security and how some people
prevent robbery through more complex locks and security cameras. I was thinking about
the possiblity of training an artifical intellienge to detect suspicious people through
the secuirty cameras or be able to detect lock picking. I was also thinking about a way to
preent poeple from opening their door to strangers. Is it possible to use camera to detect
certain keywords from the package that would match a certain information?

#### Decisions
I decided to work with Shuquan Huang, a classmate who have a similar interest in
home secuity, to make a secure system to protect residents from outside danger. We
decided to make a secure door system that would need either passcode, fingerprint,
entrance card or other means of password. We will be using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
to create our lock mechianism and use its programming language to allow it be
interactive.

We decided to split our work into multiple parts. We will start with resource gathering
and learn our respected topic. My topic is the decision-making of the Arduino and how it will
respond to the different inputs. I also need to learn more about camera and Machine
Learning to be able to create a program that can further protect the house.


#### Engineering Design Process
We are currently in the step of planning the prototype. We are currently deciding
on what items we need to buy to start creating the lock mechianism. For now, we
have decided to have a door to put the lock on and a piston lock that will lock
the door. We also plan to add a camera with the possibility of detecting strangers.

#### Skill/Skills
I am currently developing my collaboration and communication skills by working
together with a partner. By collaborating, we are able to create ideas together.
By working with a partner, I need to be able to contribute to the project by having to
do my part of the work. To make our partnership to be efficentive, communication skills
are necessary so that we are able to convey our ideas and progress with each other.
