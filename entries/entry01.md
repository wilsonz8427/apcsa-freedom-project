##### Introduction
Hello, my name is Wilson Zhang. I am a student 
Freedom Project is a project where we apply the content that we are learning by ourself to our own creation. Then we are to reflect upon our learning in a blog. Lastly, we present our product and processes to create the project.

##### _"Inspiration"_
I saw on the news that a person's home was robbed of its items because the resident opened the door for a fake delivery person. I think that these problems like these can be prevented if the person didnâ€™t open the door. If packages can be received through an automaton first, house safety can be improved. Moreover, an automaton receiving packages can also increase efficiency. For example, I always find myself being outside when my order arrives. If an automaton could receive the package for you, you would not need to rush home or go to the post office to get your packages.

##### _"My Current Decision"_
I currently decided to look further into Artificial Intelligence and learn what areas can AI be applied to. There are many languages that AI can be programmed in, such as Java, C++, or Python. AI can solve many problems that people have and can help people be more efficient. The benefits of AI can range from simple tasks, such as vacuuming, to complex tasks, such as security. For my Freedom Project, I decided to use Java for my main language because I want to add onto what we are already learning in class. I would like to try to use Java to create an AI that can receive packages for you and also notify you if the AI have received the package.
